Users can add their rescue drugs (used by asthmatic patient for asthma attacks) and regular drugs (used every day as preventers).
For each drug the users can:
- log every time they take the medicine, decreasing the number of remaining doses
- delete drug
- open in a new tab the drug information leaflet
- reset number of doses

## Asthma Control Test 

Users can take an Asthma Control Test once a month to check how well control their asthma has been for the past 4 weeks. At the end of the test the user is given a score and a small description.
